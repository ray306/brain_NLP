          <li><p><i>To what extent can NLP models predict humansâ€™ neural activity?</i></p></li>
          <li><p><i>Do NLP models differ in their predictability??</i></p></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Semantic representation, a crucial window into human cognition, has been studied independently in neuroscience and computer science. A deep understanding of neural computations in the human brain and the revolution to a strong artificial intelligence appeal for a necessity of joint force in the language domain. 

      <p>We investigated the representational formats of comparable lexical semantic features between these two complex systems with fine temporal resolution neural recordings.</p>

      <p>We found semantic representations generated from computational models significantly correlated with EEG responses at an early stage of a typical semantic processing time window in a two-word semantic priming paradigm. Moreover, three selected computational models differentially predicted EEG responses along the dynamics of word processing in the human brain. Our study provided a finer-grained understanding of the neural dynamics underlying semantic processing and developed an objective biomarker for assessing human-like computation in computational models. Our novel framework trailblazed a promising way to bridge across disciplines in the investigation of higher-order cognitive functions in human and artificial intelligence.</p>
