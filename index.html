          <li><p><i>To what extent can NLP models predict humansâ€™ neural activity?</i></p></li>
          <li><p><i>Do NLP models differ in their predictability??</i></p></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Semantic representation, a crucial window into human cognition, has been studied independently in neuroscience and computer science. A deep understanding of neural computations in the human brain and the revolution to a strong artificial intelligence appeal for a necessity of joint force in the language domain. 

      <p>We investigated the representational formats of comparable lexical semantic features between these two complex systems with fine temporal resolution neural recordings.</p>

      <p>We found semantic representations generated from computational models significantly correlated with EEG responses at an early stage of a typical semantic processing time window in a two-word semantic priming paradigm. Moreover, three selected computational models differentially predicted EEG responses along the dynamics of word processing in the human brain. Our study provided a finer-grained understanding of the neural dynamics underlying semantic processing and developed an objective biomarker for assessing human-like computation in computational models. Our novel framework trailblazed a promising way to bridge across disciplines in the investigation of higher-order cognitive functions in human and artificial intelligence.</p>

      </h2>

      <p>Within computer science,  semantic representation is the cornerstone of complex tasks such as information retrieval, question answering, machine translation, document clustering, etc. </p><p>Earlier approaches were typically confined to algorithms that require the use of expert-knowledge-based corpus like WordNet. Recent development in deep learning NLP models creates embedding representations based on the idea that lexical semantic information is reflected by word distribution. </p><p>Specifically,  embedding models learn semantic representation from words' distribution in their context in a large corpus.</p><p>Distributional information of words is compressed into dense, lower-dimensional vectors.The similarity between two words can be represented by the cosine value of the angle between the vectors

      <p>
      An electroencephalogram is a test used to find problems related to electrical activity of the brain. </p><p>An EEG tracks and records brain wave patterns. Small metal discs with thin wires (electrodes) are placed on the scalp, and then send signals to a computer to record the results.
