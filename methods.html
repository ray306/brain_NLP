        Methods: Linking semantic representations in the human brain and NLP models

      </h2>

      <p>Within computer science, semantic representation is the cornerstone of complex tasks such as information retrieval, question answering, machine translation, document clustering, etc. </p><p>
      Recent development in deep learning NLP models creates embedding representations based on the idea that lexical semantic information is reflected by word distribution. </p><p>
      Specifically, embedding models learn semantic representation from words' distribution in their context in a large corpus. The similarity between two words can be represented by the cosine value of the angle between the vectors
      </p>

      </h2>

      <p>
      Within cognitive science, ample empirical evidence has shown that the similarity of semantic representation has a profound impact on human response. 
      </p><p>
      For example, in lexical decision, widely observed priming effects consist in that humans react to a word (e.g., star) faster when it is preceded by a semantically  related word (e.g., moon -- star) than by a semantically unrelated word (e.g., monkey -- star). 
      </p><p> 
      In electrophysiological studies, N400 effects -- less neural activity around 400 ms after the onset of a more semantically expected word -- were observed in both contextual and priming settings. 
      </p>

        To compare the representations
      </h2>

      <p>
      It remains unclear to what extent representations yielded from computer models resemble to the ground truth of human representation. 
      </p><p>
      Therefore, we adopted a canonical semantic priming design that elicited the measures of semantic similarity in the brain, directly comparable to semantic representations yielded by computational models without confounding factors from compositional processing.
      </p><p>
      We predicted that the two measures from the brain and computers would correlate in a rather narrow time window within classical N400 component, presumably at the beginning of the processing purely related to semantic representation without contamination from compositional processing.
